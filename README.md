# üß† AURA: Autonomous Understanding & Reliability Analytics System

> **An end-to-end AI/ML engineering project for predictive maintenance**  
> Designed to simulate real-world industrial ML system architecture, following modern MLOps and data engineering best practices.

## üìò Project Overview

**AURA (Autonomous Understanding & Reliability Analytics System)** is a simulated industrial **Predictive Maintenance Platform** that forecasts potential equipment failures using machine learning.

The system mimics the workflow of an AI & Robotics engineering company (inspired by ARV) ‚Äî where IoT sensor data is collected, processed, modeled, deployed, and monitored in a production-like environment.

This project demonstrates **full-cycle ML engineering** ‚Äî from raw data ingestion to deployment and monitoring ‚Äî showcasing technical leadership, scalable architecture design, and strategic ML initiative planning.

## üéØ Key Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **End-to-End ML Pipeline** | Design and implement a reproducible ML pipeline covering ingestion, storage, modeling, deployment, and monitoring. |
| **Production-Ready Architecture** | Build modular components using containerized services (PostgreSQL, MinIO, Prefect, MLflow, FastAPI). |
| **Scalable Data Infrastructure** | Utilize both structured (PostgreSQL) and unstructured (S3-compatible MinIO) storage solutions. |
| **Model Lifecycle Management** | Automate model training, versioning, and retraining through Prefect + MLflow integration. |
| **Operational Excellence** | Integrate observability, data governance, and security compliance best practices (SSHE alignment). |
| **Leadership Simulation** | Demonstrate technical decision-making through documented ADRs, architecture design, and roadmap planning. |

> See the full explanation in [`docs/system_architecture.md`](./docs/system_architecture.md)

### Architecture Highlights
- **Data ingestion** via Prefect, simulating IoT / sensor streams.
- **Storage layer** split between PostgreSQL (structured) and MinIO (raw & artifacts).
- **ML pipeline** for ETL, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Model deployment** via FastAPI (Dockerized).
- **Monitoring and retraining** orchestrated with Prefect + MLflow.
- **Phase 2+ extensions:** Kafka/MQTT streaming, Feast feature store, Prometheus monitoring, and compliance layers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/aura-ml-platform.git
cd aura-ml-platform
````

### 2. Create a Python Environment

```bash
conda create -n aura python=3.10

### 4. Initialize Prefect (Optional)

```bash
prefect server start
prefect deployment apply ./prefect_flows/*.py
```

### 5. Run Sample Pipeline

```bash
python src/data_pipeline/ingest_sample.py
python src/modeling/train_model.py
```

### 6. Access Interfaces

* **Prefect UI:** [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
* **MinIO Console:** [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)
* **MLflow UI (optional):** [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
