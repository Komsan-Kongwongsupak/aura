# AURA: Autonomous Understanding and Reliability Analytics System

## Overview
AURA is a predictive maintenance platform designed to forecast potential equipment failures using machine learning. It supports industrial robotics and offshore operations by ARV-like organizations to enhance safety, efficiency, and environmental compliance.

## Problem Statement
Unplanned equipment downtime leads to high operational costs and potential safety risks. Predicting failures before they occur reduces costs and improves reliability.

## Objectives
- Build an end-to-end ML pipeline for failure prediction.
- Ensure scalability, reproducibility, and compliance.
- Demonstrate leadership in ML strategy and engineering.

## Success Metrics
- Model accuracy > 90% recall on failure detection.
- End-to-end pipeline deployable in Docker.
- Automated retraining workflow via Prefect.
